Zulip makes it possible to rename topics. This is useful for keeping messages
organized, even if some users are still learning how to use topics effectively.
You can also [move content to another
topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic).

When a topic is renamed, links [to the
topic](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#get-a-link-to-a-specific-topic)
and [to messages in that
topic](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#get-a-link-to-a-specific-message)
will automatically redirect to the new location of the message. [Muted
topics](/help/mute-a-topic) are automatically migrated when a topic is renamed.

Organization administrators can [configure](/help/restrict-moving-messages) who
is allowed to rename topics.
