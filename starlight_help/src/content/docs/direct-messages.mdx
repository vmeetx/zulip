**Direct messages (DMs)** are conversations with other users that happen outside
of a [channel](/help/introduction-to-channels). They are convenient for 1:1 and
small group conversations.

If you find yourself frequently conversing with the same person or group, it
often works best to [create a private channel](/help/create-a-channel) for your
conversations. This lets you organize your discussion into topics, and subscribe
or unsubscribe people as needed.

## Send a DM

## View your direct message conversations
