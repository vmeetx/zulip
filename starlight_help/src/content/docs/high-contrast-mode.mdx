By default, some visual elements in Zulip (such as date/time stamps, certain
buttons, links and unread counts) are intentionally light. **High contrast mode**
increases the contrast of these elements to meet the AA level of the
W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/preferences" />

  1. Under **Preferences**, select **High contrast mode**.
