By default, everyone can change their name in Zulip. You can write your name
in any language you'd like.

Organization administrators can [change anyone's name](/help/change-a-users-name), and
[prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes). This
is useful when users' names are managed via LDAP or another data source.

### Change your name

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

  1. Edit the **Name** field.
</FlattenedSteps>

<ZulipNote>
  **Note:** If you are unable to edit the name field, check
  that your organization allows name changes. Follow the steps at
  [prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes)
  to view your organization's settings.
</ZulipNote>
