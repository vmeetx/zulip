To provide information about unread messages, Zulip can show unread message
counters next to channel names in the left sidebar. This is likely to be helpful
if you generally read (or otherwise [mark as read](/help/marking-messages-as-read))
all the messages in a channel, but may otherwise feel unnecessary.

## Configure unread message counters

Zulip offers an option to display a dot instead of an unread counter for channels
in the left sidebar. You can use a dot for all channels, or just for channels you
have [muted](/help/mute-a-channel). You will still be able to see the number of
unread messages in a channel by moving your mouse over it in the left sidebar or
opening it.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/preferences" />

      1. Under **Left sidebar**, select your preferred option from the
         **Show unread counts for** dropdown.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure unread summary counters

You can configure whether Zulip displays unread count summaries on your home
view in the left sidebar. You will still be able to see the
summary counts by moving your mouse over them in the left sidebar. The counter
on your home view will also be shown when you're in that view.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Via left sidebar">
    <Steps>
      1. Hover over your configured [home view](/help/configure-home-view) in the
         **views** section of the left sidebar.
      1. Click on the **ellipsis** (<MoreVerticalIcon />).
      1. Click the option to hide or show the unread counter.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Via personal settings">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/preferences" />

      1. Under **Left sidebar**, toggle **Show unread count total on home view**.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
