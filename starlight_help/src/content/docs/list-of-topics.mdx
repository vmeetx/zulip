You can view a list of recent topics any channel. It's a great way to get an
overview if you like reading your messages one channel at a time.

## Use the list of topics in a subscribed channel

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <ChannelActions />

      1. Click **Go to list of topics**. If you do not see this option, Zulip is
         [configured](#configure-where-channel-links-in-the-left-sidebar-go) so that
         clicking on the channel name in the left sidebar will take you directly to
         the list of topics.
      1. Click on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to
         the list of topics when done (e.g., by using the **back** button in your
         browser or desktop app) to select the next conversation.
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <KeyboardTip>
      Use <kbd>Y</kbd> to go to the list of topics for the current channel.
    </KeyboardTip>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Mobile">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <MobileChannels />

      1. Select a channel.
      1. Tap **topics** (<TopicListIcon />)
         in the upper right corner of the app.
      1. Tap on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to
         the list of topics when done (e.g., by using the **back** button) to select
         the next conversation.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure where channel links in the left sidebar go

<ConfigureChannelLinks />

## Filter conversations

### Filter by topic status

In the web app, you can control whether the list of topics includes all topics,
just topics you haven't [muted](/help/mute-a-topic), or only topics you
[follow](/help/follow-a-topic).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <Steps>
      1. In the list of topics for a channel, select **All topics**, **Standard
         view**, or **Followed topics** from the dropdown in the upper left.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In muted channels, the **Standard view** includes all topics you haven't
explicitly muted.

### Filter by keyword

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <Steps>
      1. In the list of topics for a channel, use the **Filter** box at the top to
         find a conversation.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
