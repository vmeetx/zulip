<ZulipTip>
  This feature mutes a user from your personal perspective, and does not
  automatically notify anyone.
</ZulipTip>

You can mute any user you do not wish to interact with. Muting someone will
have the following effects:

* Combined feed sent by a muted user will automatically be [marked as
  read](/help/marking-messages-as-read) for you, and will never
  generate any desktop, email, or mobile push notifications.
* Combined feed sent by muted users, including the name, profile
  picture, and message content, are hidden behind a **Click here to
  reveal** banner. A revealed message can later be
  [re-hidden](/help/mute-a-user#re-hide-a-message-that-has-been-revealed).
* Muted users are hidden from [**direct messages**](/help/direct-messages)
  in the left sidebar and the list of users in the right sidebar. Direct
  messages between you and a muted user are excluded from all views,
  including search, unless you
  [explicitly search](/help/search-for-messages) for `dm-with:<that
  user>`.
* Muted users have their name displayed as "Muted user" for [emoji
  reactions][view-emoji-reactions], [polls](/help/create-a-poll), and
  when displaying the recipients of group direct messages.
* Muted users are excluded from the autocomplete for composing a
  direct message or [mentioning a user](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).
* Muted users are excluded from [read receipts](/help/read-receipts)
  for all messages. Zulip never shares whether or not you have read
  a message with a user you've muted.
* **Recent conversations** and other features that display avatars will
  show a generic user symbol in place of a muted user's profile picture.
* To avoid interfering with administration tasks, channel and
  organization settings display muted users' names and other details.

<ZulipTip>
  Muting someone does not affect their Zulip experience in any way.
