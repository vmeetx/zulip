You can configure desktop, mobile, and email notifications on a channel by
channel basis.

## Configure notifications for a single channel

These settings will override any default channel notification settings. In [muted
channels](/help/mute-a-channel), channel notification settings apply only to
[unmuted topics](/help/mute-a-topic).

      1. Click **Channel settings**.

      <SelectChannelViewPersonal />

      1. Under **Notification settings**, toggle your preferred
         notifications settings for the channel.

    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/notifications" />

      1. In the **Notification triggers** table, find the name of the channel
         you want to configure. If the channel is currently set to the default
         channel notification settings, you can select it from the **Customize
         another channel** dropdown at the bottom of the table.
      1. Toggle your preferred notifications settings for the selected
         channel.
