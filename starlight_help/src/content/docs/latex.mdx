## Insert LaTeX formatting

Zulip's compose box has a smart **Math (LaTeX)** (<MathIcon />) button, which inserts contextually appropriate LaTeX
formatting:

* If no text is selected, the button inserts displayed LaTeX (` ```math `) formatting.
* If selected text is on one line, the button inserts inline LaTeX (`$$`)
  formatting.
* If selected text is on multiple lines, the button inserts displayed LaTeX
  (` ```math `) formatting.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Via compose box button">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <StartComposing />

      1. *(optional)* Select the text you want to format.
      1. Click the **Math (LaTeX)** (<MathIcon />) icon at the
         bottom of the compose box to insert LaTeX formatting.
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <ZulipTip>
      You can also use the **Math (LaTeX)** (<MathIcon />)
      icon to remove existing LaTeX formatting from the selected text.

      1. To use inline LaTeX, use double dollar signs (`$$`) around the text:

         ```
         $$O(n^2)$$
         ```

         To use displayed LaTeX, use triple backticks and the word math
         (` ```math `) followed by some text and triple backticks at the end:

         ````
         ```math
         \int_a^b f(t)\, dt = F(b) - F(a)
         ```
         ````
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Copy and paste formatted LaTeX

### Copy LateX from a message in Zulip

Zulip supports [quoting](/help/quote-or-forward-a-message#quote-a-message),
[forwarding](/help/quote-or-forward-a-message#forward-a-message), or copying
math expressions, and pasting them into the compose box.

<ZulipTip>
  If you select part of a math expression to copy, Zulip will automatically
  expand your selection to copy the full expression.
</ZulipTip>

### Copy LaTeX from an external website

You can copy LaTeX from many third-party sites that use KaTeX, and paste it into
Zulip.

<ZulipTip>
  If copy-pasting math from a website isn't working, consider contacting the
  website's administrators with the information below, as it may be an easy fix.
</ZulipTip>

This feature is powered by KaTeX's MathML annotations, which embed the original
LaTeX source in the HTML for a math expression. For it to work, the website
needs to:

* Generate math expressions using KaTeX in the default `htmlAndMathml` [output
  mode](https://katex.org/docs/options.html).
* Allow MathML annotations to be included in HTML copied by the browser (for
  Zulip, this was [a couple lines of
  CSS](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/353f57e518b88333615911f12a031177c46d7fbe)).
