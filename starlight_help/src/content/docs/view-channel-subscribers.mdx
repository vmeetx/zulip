Who is subscribed to a channel determines who receives the messages sent there.
All non-[guest](/help/guest-users) users can view public channels and subscribe
themselves. Organization administrators can
[configure](/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-channels) who can subscribe and
unsubscribe other users to channels.
