By default, Zulip integrates with
[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/), a fully-encrypted, 100% open
source video conferencing solution. Organization administrators can also
change the organization's call provider. The call providers
supported by Zulip are:

* [Jitsi Meet](/integrations/doc/jitsi)
* [Zoom integration](/integrations/doc/zoom)
* [BigBlueButton integration](/integrations/doc/big-blue-button)

<ZulipTip>
  You can disable the video and voice call buttons for your organization
  by setting the **call provider** to "None".

as its default call provider. You can also use a self-hosted
instance of Jitsi Meet.
