## Deactivating a user

<AdminOnly />

When you deactivate a user:

* The user will be immediately logged out of all Zulip sessions, including
  desktop, web and mobile apps.
* The user's credentials for logging in will no longer work, including password
  login and [any other login options](/help/configure-authentication-methods)
  enabled in your organization.
* The user's [bots](/help/bots-overview) will be deactivated.
* [Email invitations and invite links](/help/invite-new-users) created by the
  user will be disabled.
* Other users will be able to see that the user has been deactivated (e.g., on
  their [user card](/help/user-cards)). In sidebars and elsewhere, a user's
  [availability](/help/status-and-availability) will be replaced with a
  deactivated icon
  (<UserCircleDeactivatedIcon />).
* Even if your organization [allows users to join without an
  invitation](/help/restrict-account-creation#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join),
  this user will not be able to rejoin with the same email account.

<ZulipNote>
  You must go through the deactivation process below to fully remove a user's
  access to your Zulip organization. Changing a user's password or removing
  their single sign-on account will not log them out of their open Zulip
  sessions, or disable their API keys.

## Reactivating a user

<AdminOnly />

A reactivated user will have the same role, channel subscriptions, user group
memberships, and other settings and permissions as they did prior to
deactivation. They will also have the same API key and bot API keys, but their
bots will be deactivated until the user manually
[reactivates](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-bot) them again.
