The **Channel feed** is a feed of all the topics that you have not
[muted](/help/mute-a-topic) in a particular channel. It's a great way to get a
quick overview of recent messages in a channel.

## Go to channel feed for a subscribed channel

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <ChannelActions />

      1. Click **Go to channel feed**. If you do not see this option, Zulip is
         [configured](#configure-where-channel-links-in-the-left-sidebar-go) so that
         clicking on the channel name in the left sidebar will take you directly to
         the channel feed.
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <KeyboardTip>
      Use <kbd>S</kbd> to go from a topic view to the channel feed.
    </KeyboardTip>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Mobile">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <MobileChannels />

      1. Select a channel.
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <ZulipTip>
      You can also go to the channel feed from a conversation view or from the
      [list of topics in a channel](/help/list-of-topics), by tapping the
      **channel feed** (<AllMessagesIcon />)
      icon in the upper right corner of the app.
    </ZulipTip>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Go to channel feed for an unsubscribed channel

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
