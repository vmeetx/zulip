By default, Zulip uses an image generated by
[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) as your profile picture.
If your email address already has a gravatar associated with it, Zulip will
use your existing gravatar.

You can also upload a custom profile picture to Zulip.

### Change your profile picture

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

  1. Under **Profile picture**, click **Upload new profile picture** and choose an image to upload.
</FlattenedSteps>

### Change profile picture back to gravatar

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

  1. Under **Profile picture**, click on the **(X)** icon in the top
     right corner of the profile picture.
  1. Approve by clicking **Confirm**. This will remove your current
     profile picture, reverting to the Gravatar default.
