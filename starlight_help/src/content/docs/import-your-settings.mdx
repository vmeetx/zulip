When you create a Zulip account using an email address already associated with
an account in another Zulip organization, on Zulip Cloud or the same self-hosted
Zulip installation, you can import your user settings from an existing account.
It's a convenient way to preserve the user settings that you've already customized.

<ZulipTip>
  Settings that may not apply to all organizations, such as custom profile
  fields, will not be imported.
</ZulipTip>

The import will include your:

* [Name](/help/change-your-name) and [profile picture](/help/change-your-profile-picture).
* [Preferences](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-preferences), such as the
  [theme](/help/dark-theme), [font size](/help/font-size),
  [emoji set](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set), and
  [language](/help/change-your-language) you have configured.
* [Privacy settings](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-privacy-settings),
  which include whether you let others see [when you are typing][send-typing-notifications]
  or [if you have read a message][share-read-receipts].
* [Notification settings](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-notification-settings),
  which include [default notifications for channels](/help/channel-notifications),
  [notifications for topics you follow](/help/topic-notifications), and
  [the sound used for audible desktop notifications](/help/desktop-notifications#notification-sound).
