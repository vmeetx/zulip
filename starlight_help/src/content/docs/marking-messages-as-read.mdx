Zulip automatically keeps track of which messages you have and haven't read.
Unread messages have a line along the left side, which fades when the message
gets marked as read.

Zulip offers tools to manually mark one or more messages as read, and you can
configure whether messages are marked as read automatically when you scroll.

## Configure whether messages are automatically marked as read

You can choose how messages are automatically marked as read in the Zulip web
and mobile apps. You can configure the mobile app differently from the
web/desktop app.

* **Always**: Messages are marked as read whenever you scroll through them in
  the app. You may be used to this from other chat applications.
* **Only in conversation views**: In Zulip, a **conversation** is a [direct
  message](/help/direct-messages) thread (one-on-one or with a group), or a
  [topic in a channel](/help/introduction-to-topics). This option makes it
  convenient to preview new messages in a channel, or skim [Combined
  feed](/help/combined-feed), and later read each topic in detail.
* **Never**: Messages are marked as read only manually. For example,
  if you often need to follow up on messages at your computer after
  reading them in the mobile app, you can choose this option for the
  mobile app.
