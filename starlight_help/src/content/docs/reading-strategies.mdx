In Zulip, channels determine who gets a message. Topics tell you what
the message is about. If you are not yet familiar with Zulip's topics,
we recommend first reading about [channels](/help/introduction-to-channels) and
[topics](/help/introduction-to-topics).

This article describes a few ways to efficiently read through messages
in Zulip.

## Conversation by conversation

<ReadingConversations />

### Following, muting and unmuting conversations

You can improve your workflow for catching up on messages by taking advantage of
[following topics](/help/follow-a-topic), as well as muting and unmuting
[channels](/help/mute-a-channel) and [topics](/help/mute-a-topic). Some example
workflows:

<FollowedTopicWorkflows />

## Combined views

### Combined feed

<CombinedFeed />

### Direct message feed

You can see all your direct messages in one place.

<DmFeedInstructions />

### Channel view

Sometimes it's useful to scroll through all the messages in a channel,
especially in situations where you just want a general idea of what's going
on.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <Steps>
      1. Find the channel you want to read in the left sidebar. If you don't see it
         right away, you can search for a channel by clicking on **channels** in the
         left sidebar, or using the <kbd>Q</kbd> [keyboard
         shortcut](/help/keyboard-shortcuts).
      1. Click on the channel name in the left sidebar.
      1. Read messages in the channel, starting from your first unread message. You can
         scroll using your mouse, the arrow keys, <kbd>End</kbd>, or page up/down.
      1. You can click on a topic in the left sidebar or a message recipient bar to
         view that topic.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Special views

### Mentions

The mentions view lets you quickly find all the places where you were
[mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group). Reviewing your mentions can be a
good way to start your day.

<ViewMentions />

### Starred messages

You can [star messages](/help/star-a-message) that you plan to follow up on later.

#### View starred messages

<ViewStarredMessages />

### Reactions

<ViewEmojiReactions />
