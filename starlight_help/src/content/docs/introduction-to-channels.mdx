## Browse and subscribe to channels

Everyone other than [guests](/help/guest-users) can subscribe to any
[public](/help/channel-permissions#public-channels) or
[web-public](/help/channel-permissions#web-public-channels) channel. Channel
administrators can [configure](/help/configure-who-can-subscribe) who can
subscribe to [private](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels) channels.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="relative/channel/not-subscribed" />

      1. Scroll through the list of channels. You can use the **search box** near the
         top of the menu to filter the list by channel name or description.
      1. Click the **subscribe to channel**
         (<img src="../../../../static/images/help/desktop-web-plus-icon.svg" alt="plus" class="help-center-icon" />)
         icon to the left of a channel to subscribe to it.
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <ZulipTip>
      You can click on the icons in the upper right to sort the list of channels
      **by name** (<SortAlphaAscIcon />),
      **by number of subscribers** (<UserOIcon />), or
      **by estimated weekly traffic** (<BarChartIcon />).
    </ZulipTip>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Mobile">
    Access this feature by following the web app instructions in your mobile
    device browser. You can also follow a link to an unsubscribed channel in
    a Zulip message, press and hold the channel name until the long-press menu
    appears, and tap **Subscribe**.

    Implementation of a list of channels to subscribe to in the mobile app is
    tracked [on GitHub](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/188).
    If you're interested in this feature, please react to the issue's
    description with üëç.
