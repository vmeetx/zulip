Read receipts let you check who has read a message. You can see read receipts
for any message, including both [channel messages](/help/introduction-to-channels)
and [direct messages](/help/direct-messages).

With privacy in mind, Zulip lets you [control][configure-personal-read-receipts]
whether your read receipts are shared, and administrators can
[choose][configure-organization-read-receipts] whether to enable read receipts in
their organization.

<ZulipTip>
  Read receipts reflect whether or not someone has marked a message as read,
  whether by viewing it, or [by marking messages as read in
  bulk](/help/marking-messages-as-read).
</ZulipTip>

## View who has read a message

    <FlattenedSteps>
      <MessageActionsMenu />

## Configure whether Zulip lets others see when you've read messages

Zulip supports the privacy option of never sharing whether or not you have read
a message. If this setting is turned off, your name will never appear in the
list of read receipts.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/account-and-privacy" />

  1. Under **Privacy**, toggle **Let others see when I've read messages**.
</FlattenedSteps>

## Configure read receipts for your organization

You can configure:

* Whether read receipts are enabled in your organization.
* Whether new users will allow others to view read receipts by default. (Note

### Configure whether read receipts are enabled in your organization
