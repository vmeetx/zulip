It's easy to find the right conversation with Zulip's powerful search. When you
find the message you were looking for, go directly to its topic for full context.

Whenever you need a reminder of the search filters that Zulip offers, check out
the convenient [**search filters**](#search-filters-reference) reference
in the Zulip web and desktop apps.

## Keyword search

Zulip lets you search messages and topics by keyword. For example:

* `new logo`: Search for messages with both `new` and `logo` in the message or
  its topic.
* `"new logo"`: Search for messages with the phrase "`new logo`" in the message
  or its topic.

Some details to keep in mind:

* Keywords are case-insensitive, so `wave` will also match `Wave`.
* Zulip will find messages containing similar keywords (keywords with the same
  stem), so, e.g., `wave` will match `waves` and `waving`.
* Zulip search ignores very common words like `a`, `the`, and about 100 others.
* [Emoji](/help/emoji-and-emoticons) in messages (but not [emoji
  reactions](/help/emoji-reactions)) are included in searches, so if you search
  for `thumbs_up`, your results will include messages with the `:thumbs_up:` emoji (üëç).

## Search filters

Zulip also offers a wide array of search filters, which can be used on their
own, or in combination with keywords. For example:

* `channel:design`: Navigate to **#design**.
* `channel:design logo`: Search for the keyword `logo` within **#design**.
* `channel:design has:image new logo`: Search for messages in **#design** that
  include an image and contain the keywords `new` and `logo`. The keywords can
  appear in the message itself or its topic.

<ZulipTip>
  As you start typing into the search box, Zulip will suggest search filters
  you can use.
</ZulipTip>

### Search by location

Sometimes you know approximately where the message you are looking for was sent.
Zulip offers the following filters based on the location of the message.

* `channel:design`: Search within the channel **#design**.
* `channel:design topic:new+logo`: Search within the topic "new logo" in
  **#design**.
* `is:dm`: Search all your direct messages.
* `dm:Bo Lin`: Search 1-on-1 direct messages between you and Bo.
* `dm:Bo Lin, Elena Garc√≠a`: Search group direct messages
  between you, Bo, and Elena.
* `dm-including:Bo Lin`: Search all direct message conversations
  (1-on-1 and group) that include you and Bo, as well as any other users.

### Search shared history

To avoid cluttering your search results, by default, Zulip searches just the
messages you received. You can use `channels:` or `channel:` filters to search
additional messages.

* `channels:public`: Search messages in all
  [public](/help/channel-permissions#public-channels) and
  [web-public](/help/channel-permissions#web-public-channels) channels.
* `channels:web-public`: Search messages in all
  [web-public](/help/change-the-privacy-of-a-channel) channels in the organization,
  including channels you are not subscribed to.
* `channel:design`: Search all messages in **#design**, including messages sent
  before you were a subscriber.

### Search by sender

* `sender:Elena Garc√≠a`: Search messages sent by Elena.
* `sender:me`: Search messages you've sent.

<ZulipTip>
  You can also access all messages someone has sent [via their **user
  card**](/help/view-messages-sent-by-a-user).
</ZulipTip>

### Search for attachments or links

* `has:link`: Search messages that contain URLs.
* `has:attachment`: Search messages that contain an [uploaded
  file](/help/share-and-upload-files).
* `has:image`: Search messages that contain uploaded or linked images or videos.

<ZulipTip>
  You can also [view](/help/manage-your-uploaded-files) all the files you
  have uploaded or [browse](/help/view-images-and-videos) all the images and
  videos in the current view.
</ZulipTip>

### Search your important messages

* `is:alerted`: Search messages that contain your [alert
  words](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications#alert-words). Messages are
  included in the search results based on the alerts you had configured when you
  received the message.
* `is:mentioned`: Search messages where you were
  [mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).
* `is:starred`: Search your [starred messages](/help/star-a-message).

### Search by message status

* `is:followed`: Search messages in [followed topics](/help/follow-a-topic).
* `is:resolved`: Search messages in [resolved topics](/help/resolve-a-topic).
* `-is:resolved`: Search messages in [unresolved topics](/help/resolve-a-topic).
* `is:unread`: Search your unread messages.
* `is:muted`: Search [muted](/help/mute-a-topic) messages.
* `-is:muted`: Search only [unmuted](/help/mute-a-topic) messages. By default,
  both muted and unmuted messages are included in keyword search results.
* `has:reaction`: Search messages with [emoji reactions](/help/emoji-reactions).

### Search by message ID

Each message in Zulip has a unique ID, which is used for [linking to a specific
message](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#link-to-zulip-from-anywhere).
You can use the search bar to navigate to a message by its ID.

* `near:12345`: Show messages around the message with ID `12345`.
* `id:12345`: Show only message `12345`.
* `channel:design near:1` Show the oldest messages in the **#design** channel.

### Exclude filters

All of Zulip's search filters can be negated to **exclude** messages matching
the specified rule. For example:

* `channel:design -is:resolved -has:image`: Search messages in [unresolved
  topics](/help/resolve-a-topic) in the **#design** channel that don't contain
  images.

## Linking to search results

When you search Zulip, the URL shown in the address bar of the Zulip web app is a
permanent link to your search. You can share this link with others, and they
will see *their own* search results for your query.

## Search filters reference

A summary of the search filters above is available in the Zulip app.
