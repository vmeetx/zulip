Zulip shows previews of attached images and videos, unless previews are
[disabled](/help/image-video-and-website-previews) in your organization.
You can click on a preview to view an image in more detail, or to play a
video. Zulip also makes it convenient to browse all images and videos
attached to messages in your current view.

## Browse images and videos

the current view. For example, if you're in a channel view, you'll be able
to browse through all the images and videos in that channel. If you do a
[search](/help/search-for-messages), the **viewer** will display all the
images and videos in messages matching that search.
