Zulip lets you manually mark messages as unread. Specifically, Zulip offers a
**Mark as unread from here** option, which lets you mark the selected message
and all newer messages in your current view as unread.

There are many ways to use this feature, including:

* When you don't have time to read a conversation carefully, or to follow up on
  action items, mark messages as unread to return to them later.
* You can mark messages as unread when you [subscribe to a
  channel](/help/introduction-to-channels#browse-and-subscribe-to-channels). This makes it
  [convenient](/help/reading-strategies) to review all the recent
  conversations in that channel.
* Mark the results of your [search](/help/search-for-messages) as unread to
  review them at leisure.
