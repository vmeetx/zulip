Zulip lets you adjust line spacing in the web and desktop apps, to
make the Zulip interface feel most comfortable for you. Most
importantly, this setting modifies how much space there is between
lines of text in multi-line messages. You can experiment to see what
configuration makes reading most pleasant for you.

Reducing line spacing and [font size](/help/font-size) may be helpful on small
screens, so that you can see more content at a time.

## Change line spacing

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <PersonalMenu />

      1. Click <PlusIcon /> to increase the line
         spacing, <MinusIcon /> to decrease it, and <LineHeightBigIcon /> to reset to the default.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
