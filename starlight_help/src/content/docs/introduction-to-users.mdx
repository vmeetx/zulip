title: Introduction to users

A **user** is an individual's account within a Zulip
[organization](/help/join-a-zulip-organization). Administrators can
[configure](/help/restrict-account-creation) how accounts are created in their
organization, and [how users will log
in](/help/configure-authentication-methods).

Zulip lets users and organization administrators configure the following
details. This information is summarized in a user's [card](/help/user-cards),
and presented in detail in their [profile](/help/view-someones-profile).

* [Profile picture](/help/change-your-profile-picture)
* [Name](/help/change-your-name)
* [Role](/help/user-roles) in the organization
* [Status and availability](/help/status-and-availability), and whether
  the account has been [deactivated](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user)
* Current [local time](/help/change-your-timezone)
* Email address, with configurable [permissions to view it](/help/configure-email-visibility)
* [Custom profile fields](/help/custom-profile-fields)

Users can also be members of [groups](/help/user-groups), and subscribe to
[channels](/help/introduction-to-channels).
