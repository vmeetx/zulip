Zulip lets you separately configure permissions for editing and deleting
messages, and you can set time limits for both actions. Regardless of the
configuration you select, message content can only ever be modified by the
original author.

Note that if a user can edit a message, they can also “delete” it by removing
all the message content. This is different from proper message deletion in two
ways: the original content will still show up in [message edit
history](/help/view-a-messages-edit-history), and will be included in
[data exports](/help/export-your-organization). Deletion permanently (and
irretrievably) removes the message from Zulip.

## Configure message editing permissions

<ZulipTip>
  Users can only edit their own messages.
</ZulipTip>

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-permissions" />

  1. Under **Message editing**:
     * Toggle **Allow message editing**.
     * Configure **Time limit for editing messages**.

  <SaveChanges />
</FlattenedSteps>

## Configure message deletion permissions

These permissions can be granted to any combination of
[roles](/help/user-roles), [groups](/help/user-groups), and individual
[users](/help/introduction-to-users).

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-permissions" />

  1. Under **Message deletion**:
     * Configure **Who can delete any message**.
     * Configure **Who can delete their own messages everywhere**.
     * Configure **Time limit for deleting messages**. This time limit does not
       apply to users who can delete any message.
     * Configure **Who can allow users to delete messages in channels they
       administer**.

  <SaveChanges />
</FlattenedSteps>

<ZulipTip>
  A user can delete messages sent by [bots that they
  own](/help/view-your-bots) just like messages they sent themself.
</ZulipTip>

## Configure who can delete messages in a specific channel

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="relative/channel/all" />

      1. Select a channel.

      <SelectChannelViewGeneralAdvanced />

      1. Under **Moderation permissions**, configure **Who can delete any message in
         this channel** and **Who can delete their own messages in this channel**.

      <SaveChanges />
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
