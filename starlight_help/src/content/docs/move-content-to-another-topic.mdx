title: Move content to another topic

import {TabItem, Tabs} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import FlattenedSteps from "../../components/FlattenedSteps.astro";

import MessageActionsMenu from "./include/_MessageActionsMenu.mdx";

Zulip makes it possible to move messages between topics. This is
useful for keeping messages organized when there is a digression, or
the discussion shifts from the original topic. You can also [rename a
topic](/help/rename-a-topic).

When messages are moved, Zulip's [permanent links to messages in
context](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#get-a-link-to-a-specific-message)
will automatically redirect to the new location of the message. [Muted
topics](/help/mute-a-topic) are automatically migrated when an entire
topic is moved.

Organization administrators can [configure](/help/restrict-moving-messages) who
is allowed to move messages.
