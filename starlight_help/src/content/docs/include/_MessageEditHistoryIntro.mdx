In Zulip, users who have the appropriate permissions can
[edit](/help/edit-a-message) the content of a message they sent, or move
messages to a different [channel](/help/move-content-to-another-channel)
or [topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic).

Modified messages are tagged as **edited** or **moved**, with the **edited**
indicator taking priority. You can view the history of how a message was
edited and moved, if this is allowed in your organization.
