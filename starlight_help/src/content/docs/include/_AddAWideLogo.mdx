You can customize the logo users see in the top left corner
of the Zulip app. For best results:

* The logo should be a wide rectangle image with an 8:1 width to height ratio.
  It will be displayed at 200Ã—25 pixels, or more on high-resolution displays.
* Make sure your logo has a transparent background, and trim any bordering
  whitespace.

To upload a logo:

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-profile" />

  1. Under **Organization logo**, upload a new logo.
</FlattenedSteps>

Make sure to test the logo in both light theme and [dark theme](/help/dark-theme).
