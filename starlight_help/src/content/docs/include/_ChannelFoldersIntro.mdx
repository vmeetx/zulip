Organizations can sort channels into folders. For example, you can put all the
channels associated with a team into a dedicated folder. Channels will be
grouped into folders in the [**Inbox**](/help/inbox) view, and users can
[decide](/help/channel-folders#configure-whether-channels-are-grouped-by-folder-in-the-left-sidebar)
whether to group them by folder in the [left sidebar](/help/left-sidebar).

Everyone can [pin channels](/help/pin-a-channel) they personally want to pay
close attention to. Pinned channels appear in a dedicated **pinned channels**
section above channel folders.
