You can configure a default set of channels that users will be subscribed to
when they join your organization. Default channels must be [public or
web-public](/help/channel-permissions). Users will be
subscribed to the default channels configured at the time when they
accept the invitation, so there's no need to update or revoke invitations when
you change the default channels.

When you [send an email
invitation](/help/invite-new-users#send-email-invitations) or [create a reusable
invitation link](/help/invite-new-users#create-a-reusable-invitation-link), you
can customize which channels the invited users are subscribed to. Note that
subscribing new users to a channel generally requires having
[permissions](/help/channel-permissions) to do so, but anyone with
[permissions](/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations)
to invite new users can subscribe them to any combination of default channels.
