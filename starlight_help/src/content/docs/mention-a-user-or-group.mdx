## Silently mention a user

A silent mention allows you to refer to a user without triggering a
notification. Silent mentions start with `@_` instead of `@`.

  1. Pick the appropriate user or user group from the autocomplete.
</FlattenedSteps>

## Mention all topic participants

Using the `@**topic**` mention, you can mention everyone who has previously
participated in the topic by sending a message or
[reacting](/help/emoji-reactions) with an emoji. This lets you notify just those
who have already engaged in the conversation.

Users can disable notifications for `@**topic**` mentions by:

* Disabling notifications for wildcard mentions
  [globally](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
  channels](/help/channel-notifications).
* Muting the [topic](/help/mute-a-topic) or [channel](/help/mute-a-channel).

## Mention everyone on a channel

You can mention everyone on a channel with the `@**all**` mention (or,
equivalently, `@**everyone**` or `@**channel**`). It's best to use these mentions
only when your message requires timely attention from many channel subscribers.
An organization can be configured to
[restrict](/help/restrict-wildcard-mentions) wildcard mentions in large channels.

Users can disable notifications for `@**all**`, `@**everyone**`, and
`@**channel**` mentions by:

* Disabling notifications for wildcard mentions
  [globally](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
  channels](/help/channel-notifications).
* Muting the [topic](/help/mute-a-topic) or [channel](/help/mute-a-channel).
