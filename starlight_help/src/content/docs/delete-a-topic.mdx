We generally recommend against deleting topics, but there are a few
situations in which it can be useful:

* Clearing out test messages after setting up an organization.
* Clearing out messages from an overly enthusiastic bot.
* Managing abuse.

In most other cases, [renaming a topic](/help/rename-a-topic) is often a
better idea, or just leaving the topic as is. Deleting a topic can confuse
users who come to the topic later via an email notification.

Note that deleting a topic also deletes every message with that topic,
whereas [archiving a channel](/help/archive-a-channel) does not.

### Delete a topic

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <TopicActions />

      1. Click **Delete topic**.
      1. Approve by clicking **Confirm**.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Mobile">
    Access this feature by following the web app instructions in your
    mobile device browser.

    Implementation of this feature in the mobile app is tracked [on
    GitHub](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/1549). If
    you're interested in this feature, please react to the issue's
    description with üëç.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that deleting all of the individual messages within a particular
topic also deletes that topic. Structurally, topics are simply an
attribute of messages in Zulip.
