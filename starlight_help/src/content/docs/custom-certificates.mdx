By default, Zulip generates a signed certificate during the server install
process. In some cases, a server administrator may choose not to use that
feature, in which case your Zulip server may be using a self-signed
certificate. This is most common for Zulip servers not connected to the
public internet.

## Web

Most browsers will show a warning if you try to connect to a Zulip server
with a self-signed certificate.

If you are absolutely, 100% sure that the Zulip server you are connecting to
is supposed to have a self-signed certificate, click through the warnings
and follow the instructions on-screen.

If you are less than 100% sure, contact your server
administrator. Accepting a malicious self-signed certificate would
give a stranger full access to your Zulip account, including your
username and password.

## Desktop

### Version 5.4.0 and above

Zulip Desktop version 5.4.0 and above use the operating system's
certificate store, like your web browser.

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    The required packages and steps vary by distribution; see the Chromium
    documentation for [detailed documentation][linux].  On most systems,
    once the `nss` tools are installed, the command to trust the
    certificate is:

    ```bash "path/to/certificate.pem"
    certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n zulip \
      -i path/to/certificate.pem
    ```

    You will need to restart the Zulip Desktop application to pick up the
    new certificate.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Version 5.3.0 and below

On Zulip Desktop version 5.3.0 and below, we require you to manually
enter the certificate details before you can connect to your Zulip
server. You'll need to get a certificate file (should end in `.crt` or
`.pem`) from your server administrator and add it:

<FlattenedSteps>
  <DesktopSidebarSettingsMenu />

  1. Select the **Organizations** tab.
  1. Under **Add Custom Certificates**, enter your organization URL and add
     the custom certificate file (it should end in `.crt` or `.pem`).
