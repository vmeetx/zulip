Organization administrators and [channel
administrators](/help/configure-who-can-administer-a-channel) can always make a
channel private. However, they can only make a private channel public or
web-public if they have content access to it:

<ContentAccessDefinition />

<ZulipNote>
  **Warning**: Be careful making a private channel public. All past messages
  will become accessible, even if the channel previously had protected history.
</ZulipNote>
