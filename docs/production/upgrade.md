# Upgrade Zulip

This page explains how to upgrade a Zulip server, including:

- [Upgrading to a release](#upgrading-to-a-release)
- [Upgrading from a Git repository](#upgrading-from-a-git-repository)
- [Updating `settings.py` inline documentation](#updating-settingspy-inline-documentation)
- [Troubleshooting and rollback](#troubleshooting-and-rollback)
- [Preserving local changes to service configuration files](#preserving-local-changes-to-service-configuration-files)
- [Upgrading PostgreSQL](#upgrading-postgresql)
- [Upgrading the operating system](#upgrading-the-operating-system)

We recommend always running [the latest Zulip server
release](../overview/release-lifecycle.md#stable-releases). We work extremely
hard to make sure these releases are stable and have no regressions, and that
the upgrade process Just Works.

If you do have any questions or problems with your upgrade process, best-effort
community support is available in the [Zulip development
community](https://zulip.com/development-community/).

## Upgrading to a release

:::{important}

Be sure to follow the additional instructions if you're [using
docker-zulip][docker-upgrade], have [patched Zulip](modify.md), or have
[modified Zulip-managed configuration
files](#preserving-local-changes-to-service-configuration-files).

:::

To upgrade to a new Zulip release:

1. Read the [upgrade notes](../overview/changelog.md#upgrade-notes) for all
   releases between your current release and the one you're upgrading to.

1. [Download](https://download.zulip.com/server/) the appropriate release
   tarball. You can get the latest release (**Zulip Server
   {{ LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION }}**) with the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -fLO https://download.zulip.com/server/zulip-server-latest.tar.gz
   ```

1. Log in to your Zulip, and run as root:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip zulip-server-latest.tar.gz
   ```

Once the Zulip upgrade is complete, you may also wish to [upgrade the version of
PostgreSQL](#upgrading-postgresql).

### What to expect during an upgrade

The upgrade process will:

1. Run `apt-get upgrade`.
1. Install new versions of Zulip's dependencies (mainly Python packages).
1. Shut down the Zulip service.
1. Run a `puppet apply`.
1. Run any database migrations.
1. Bring the Zulip service back up on the new version.

Upgrading will result in brief downtime for the service, which should
be under 30 seconds unless there is an expensive database migration
involved. Such migrations will be documented in the [release
notes](../overview/changelog.md), and can usually can be avoided with
some care. If downtime is problematic for your organization,
consider testing the upgrade on a
[backup](export-and-import.md#backups) in advance,
doing the final upgrade at off hours, or arranging support.

:::{note}

If you run into any issues or need to roll back the upgrade, see the
[troubleshooting guide](#troubleshooting-and-rollback).

:::

## Upgrading from a Git repository

:::{important}

If you are upgrading docker-zulip, please follow [these
instructions](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).

:::

Zulip supports upgrading a production installation to any commit in a Git
repository. This lets you get unreleased features and bugfixes, or [maintain a
fork](modify.md#making-changes) of Zulip.

### Upgrading to an unreleased version of Zulip

The [git versions](../overview/release-lifecycle.md#git-versions) documentation
describes some branches you may choose to upgrade to, depending on your
requirements.

If you are considering upgrading to `main`, see our [upgrading to `main`
guide](modify.md#upgrading-to-main) for detailed information. You can also
[apply a small change](modify.md#applying-changes-from-main) to get a fix for an
issue that matters for your organization.

To upgrade to a branch from Git, simply run:

```bash
# Upgrade to an official release
/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git 9.4

# Upgrade to a maintenance branch
/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git 9.x

# Upgrade to the Zulip Cloud branch
/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git zulip-cloud-current

# Upgrade to the `main` branch
/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git 9.4
```

Zulip will automatically fetch the relevant Git commit and upgrade to
that version of Zulip.

In addition to the steps described [above](#what-to-expect-during-an-upgrade),
the upgrade process will also build Zulip's frontend assets using `webpack`.

#### Upgrading from another repository

By default, this uses the main upstream Zulip server repository, but
you can configure any other Git repository by adding a section like
this to `/etc/zulip/zulip.conf`:

```ini
[deployment]
git_repo_url = https://github.com/zulip/zulip.git
```

## Updating `settings.py` inline documentation

Zulip installations often upgrade many times over their lifetime, and we strive
to keep all configuration files backwards-compatible. The
`/etc/zulip/settings.py` file is not automatically modified during upgrades.

After an upgrade, new features may thus be missing from that file, as it is
based on a template provided by an earlier version of Zulip.

After upgrading across major versions of Zulip Server, we recommend
comparing your `/etc/zulip/settings.py` file to the current settings
template, which can be found in
`/home/zulip/deployments/current/zproject/prod_settings_template.py`. We
suggest using that updated template to update
`/etc/zulip/settings.py`:

1. Copy the current `settings.py` to make a backup (especially if you
   do not have a recent [complete backup][backups]), and make a copy
   of the current template:

   ```bash
   cp -a /etc/zulip/settings.py ~/zulip-settings-backup.py
   cp -a /home/zulip/deployments/current/zproject/prod_settings_template.py /etc/zulip/settings-new.py
   ```

1. Open both `/etc/zulip/settings.py` and `/etc/zulip/settings-new.py`
   files in an editor; for each setting set in `settings.py`, find its
   section in `/etc/zulip/settings-new.py` and copy the setting from
   `settings.py` into there.

   To help with this process, the following tool finds the most likely version
   of the template that your `/etc/zulip/settings.py` was installed from, and
   shows the modifications you've made:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/compare-settings-to-template
   ```

   If there are settings which you cannot find documented in
   `/etc/zulip/settings-new.py`, check the [changelog][changelog] to see
   if they have been removed.

1. Overwrite the configuration with the updated file, and restart the
   server to pick up the updates; this should be a no-op, but it is
   much better to discover immediately if it is not:

   ```bash
   cp -a /etc/zulip/settings-new.py /etc/zulip/settings.py
   su zulip -c '/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/restart-server'
   ```

[backups]: export-and-import.md#backups
[changelog]: ../overview/changelog.md

## Troubleshooting and rollback

The upgrade scripts are idempotent, so there's no harm in trying again
after resolving an issue. The most common causes of errors are:

- Networking issues (e.g., your Zulip server doesn't have reliable
  Internet access or needs a proxy set up). Fix the networking issue
  and try again.
- Especially when using `upgrade-zulip-from-git`, systems with the
  minimal RAM for running Zulip can run into out-of-memory issues
  during the upgrade process (generally `tools/webpack` is the step
  that fails). You can get past this by shutting down the Zulip
  server with `./scripts/stop-server` to free up RAM before running
  the upgrade process.

Useful logs are available in a few places:

- The Zulip upgrade scripts log all output to
  `/var/log/zulip/upgrade.log`.
- The Zulip server logs all Internal Server Errors to
  `/var/log/zulip/errors.log`.

See also the general Zulip server [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).

### Rolling back to a prior version

This rollback process is intended for minor releases (e.g., `9.4` to
`9.3`); a more complicated process is required to roll back database
migrations before downgrading to an older major release.

The Zulip upgrade process works by creating a new deployment under
`/home/zulip/deployments/` containing a complete copy of the Zulip server code,
and then moving the symlinks at `/home/zulip/deployments/{current,last,next}`
as part of the upgrade process.

This means that if the new version isn't working,
you can quickly downgrade to the old version by running
`/home/zulip/deployments/last/scripts/restart-server`, or to an
earlier previous version by running
`/home/zulip/deployments/DATE/scripts/restart-server`. The
`restart-server` script stops any running Zulip server, and starts
the version corresponding to the `restart-server` path you call.

## Deployment hooks

Zulip's upgrades have a hook system which allows for arbitrary
user-configured actions to run before and after an upgrade.

Files in the `/etc/zulip/pre-deploy.d` and `/etc/zulip/post-deploy.d`
directories are inspected for files ending with `.hook`, just before and after
the critical period when the server is restarted. Files are called from the
working directory of the new version in alphabetical order, with
environment variables as described below. If any of them exit with non-0 exit
code, the upgrade will abort.

The hook is run with the following environment variables set:

- `ZULIP_OLD_VERSION`: The version being upgraded from, which may either be a
  release name (e.g., `10.0` or `10.0-beta1`) or the output from `git describe`
  (e.g., `10.0-beta1-2-abcd158b18f2`).
- `ZULIP_NEW_VERSION`: The version being upgraded to, in the same format as
  `ZULIP_OLD_VERSION`.

If the upgrade is upgrading between [versions in `git`][upgrade-from-git], then
the following environment variables will also be present:

- `ZULIP_OLD_COMMIT`: The full commit hash of the version being upgraded from.
- `ZULIP_NEW_COMMIT`: The full commit hash of the version being upgraded to.
- `ZULIP_OLD_MERGE_BASE_COMMIT`: The full commit hash of the merge-base of the
  version being upgraded from, and the public branch in
  [`zulip/zulip`][zulip/zulip]. This will be the closest commit in standard
  Zulip Server to the version being upgraded from.
- `ZULIP_NEW_MERGE_BASE_COMMIT`: The full commit hash of the merge-base of the
  version being upgraded to, and the public branch in
  [`zulip/zulip`][zulip/zulip]. This will be the closest commit in standard
  Zulip Server to the version being upgraded to.

See the [deploy documentation](deployment.md#deployment-hooks) for
hooks included with Zulip.

## Preserving local changes to service configuration files

:::{warning}
If you have modified service configuration files installed by
Zulip (e.g., the nginx configuration), the Zulip upgrade process will
overwrite your configuration when it does the `puppet apply`.
:::

You can test whether any files will be overwritten assuming no upstream changes
to the configuration using `scripts/zulip-puppet-apply` (without the `-f`
option), which will do a test Puppet run and output and changes it would make.
Using this list, you can save a copy of any files that you've modified, do the
upgrade, and then restore your configuration.

That said, Zulip's configuration files are designed to be flexible
enough for a wide range of installations, from a small self-hosted
system to Zulip Cloud. Before making local changes to a configuration
file, first check whether there's an option supported by
`/etc/zulip/zulip.conf` for the customization you need. And if you
need to make local modifications, please report the issue so that we
can look into making the Zulip Puppet configuration flexible enough to
handle your setup.

### nginx configuration changes

If you need to extend Zulip's `nginx` configuration, there are a few different
include directories you can use, in different [contexts][context]:

- `/etc/nginx/conf.d` is in the [`http` context][http-context]
- `/etc/nginx/zulip-include/app.d` is in the [`server` context][server-context]
  for the public-facing server
- `/etc/nginx/zulip-include/localhost.d` is in the [`server`
  context][server-context] for the server listening on `127.0.0.1:80`, which is
  used for internal inter-process communication

[context]: http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure

## Upgrading PostgreSQL

The major version of PostgreSQL is upgraded separately from the Zulip
server version. Further, the version of PostgreSQL included with a
Zulip server is not linked to that of the host OS; the Zulip installer
uses the latest available version of PostgreSQL at installation time
(currently, version 16).

The following table details which versions each major Zulip Server
version supports:

```{include} postgresql-support-table.md

```

To upgrade the version of PostgreSQL on the Zulip server:

1. Upgrade your Zulip server, at least to the latest Zulip maintenance
   release for your major Zulip version (e.g., upgrade 9.1 to
   9.4). This ensures you're using the most robust version of the
   PostgreSQL upgrade tool.

1. Stop the server, as the `zulip` user:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/stop-server
   ```

1. Take a backup, in case of any problems:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py backup --output=/home/zulip/postgresql-upgrade.backup.tar.gz
   ```

1. As root, run the database upgrade tool:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/upgrade-postgresql
   ```

1. As the `zulip` user, start the server again:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/start-server
   ```

You should now be able to navigate to the Zulip server's URL and
confirm everything is working correctly.

## Upgrading the operating system

When you upgrade the operating system on which Zulip is installed
(e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 to Ubuntu 24.04), you need to take some additional
steps to update your Zulip installation, documented below.

The steps are largely the same for the various OS upgrades aside from
the versions of PostgreSQL, so you should be able to adapt these
instructions for other supported platforms.

### Upgrading from Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy to 24.04 Noble

1. Upgrade your server to the latest Zulip `8.x` release (at
   least 8.3, which adds support for Ubuntu 24.04).

1. As the Zulip user, stop the Zulip server and run the following
   to back up the system:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/stop-server
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py backup --output=/home/zulip/release-upgrade.backup.tar.gz
   ```

1. One of Zulip's dependencies, RabbitMQ, is used to store deferred work
   in queues. RabbitMQ's Ubuntu packaging has [problems][rabbitmq-bug]
   upgrading from version 3.9 in Ubuntu 22.04 to 3.12 in Ubuntu
   24.04. To work around this bug, you'll need to uninstall
   `rabbitmq-server`, purging its database, before upgrading the OS;
   the steps after the OS upgrade will reinstall the new version and
   configure it properly. You can do this uninstallation process
   safely via the following process:

   1. As root, run:
      ```bash
      rabbitmqctl list_queues
      ```
      to check whether any of Zulip's RabbitMQ queues contain
      unprocessed events.
   1. If any queues contain events, you can run as the `zulip` user
      ```bash
      /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py process_queue --all
      ```
      ...which will start all workers consuming any remaining events.
      You should cancel this (with ^C) once `rabitmqctl list_queues`
      shows that no queues contain events anymore. You can also decide
      to skip this step if you're OK losing a bit of data of the
      relevant type.
   1. As root, run `apt purge rabbitmq-server` to remove the RabbitMQ
      package, including, critically, its database and configuration
      state, which would otherwise cause installation of the Ubuntu
      24.04 package to crash.

1. Switch to the root user and upgrade the operating system, following
   the prompts until it completes successfully:

   ```bash
   sudo -i # Or otherwise get a root shell
   do-release-upgrade
   ```

   When `do-release-upgrade` asks you how to upgrade configuration
   files for services that Zulip manages like Redis, PostgreSQL,
   nginx, and memcached, the best choice is `N` to keep the
   currently installed version. But it's not important; the next
   step will re-install Zulip's configuration in any case.

   The `do-release-upgrade` tool will complete by prompting you to
   restart the system; press `N`, as we will do so later.

1. Next, we need to reinstall the current version of Zulip, which
   among other things will recompile Zulip's Python module
   dependencies for your new version of Python and rewrite Zulip's
   full-text search indexes to work with the upgraded dictionary
   packages. This will also take care of re-installing and re-configuring
   RabbitMQ which we removed earlier.

   ```bash
   rm -rf /srv/zulip-venv-cache/* /home/zulip/deployments/current/.venv /root/.cache/uv
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/lib/upgrade-zulip-stage-2 \
       /home/zulip/deployments/current/ --ignore-static-assets --audit-fts-indexes
   ```

   This process may show a dialog about a "pending kernel upgrade",
   which can safely be ignored. It may also prompt about "daemons
   using outdated libraries"; you should select "cancel".

1. As root, upgrade the database to the latest version of PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/upgrade-postgresql
   ```

1. As root, restart the server:

   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

You should now be able to navigate to your Zulip server's URL and
confirm everything is working correctly.

### Upgrading from Ubuntu 20.04 Focal to 22.04 Jammy

1. Upgrade your server to the latest Zulip `5.x` release (at
   least 5.3, which adds support for Ubuntu 22.04 and above).

2. As the Zulip user, stop the Zulip server and run the following
   to back up the system:

   ```bash
   supervisorctl stop all
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py backup --output=/home/zulip/release-upgrade.backup.tar.gz
   ```

3. Switch to the root user and upgrade the operating system, following
   the prompts until it completes successfully:

   ```bash
   sudo -i # Or otherwise get a root shell
   do-release-upgrade
   ```

   When `do-release-upgrade` asks you how to upgrade configuration
   files for services that Zulip manages like Redis, PostgreSQL,
   nginx, and memcached, the best choice is `N` to keep the
   currently installed version. But it's not important; the next
   step will re-install Zulip's configuration in any case.

   The `do-release-upgrade` tool will complete by prompting you to
   restart the system; press `N`, as we will do so later.

4. Next, we need to reinstall the current version of Zulip, which
   among other things will recompile Zulip's Python module
   dependencies for your new version of Python and rewrite Zulip's
   full-text search indexes to work with the upgraded dictionary
   packages:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /srv/zulip-venv-cache/*
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/lib/upgrade-zulip-stage-2 \
       /home/zulip/deployments/current/ --ignore-static-assets --audit-fts-indexes
   ```

   This process may show a dialog about a "pending kernel upgrade",
   which can safely be ignored. It may also prompt about "daemons
   using outdated libraries"; you should select "cancel".

5. As root, upgrade the database to the latest version of PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/upgrade-postgresql
   ```

6. As root, restart the server:

   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

You should now be able to navigate to your Zulip server's URL and
confirm everything is working correctly.

### Upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic to 20.04 Focal

1. Upgrade your server to the latest Zulip `3.x` or `4.x` release (at
   least 3.0, which adds support for Ubuntu 20.04). You can only
   upgrade to Zulip 5.0 and newer after completing this process, since
   newer releases don't support Ubuntu 18.04.

2. As the Zulip user, stop the Zulip server and run the following
   to back up the system:

   ```bash
   supervisorctl stop all
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py backup --output=/home/zulip/release-upgrade.backup.tar.gz
   ```

3. Switch to the root user and upgrade the operating system, following
   the prompts until it completes successfully:

   ```bash
   sudo -i # Or otherwise get a root shell
   do-release-upgrade
   ```

   When `do-release-upgrade` asks you how to upgrade configuration
   files for services that Zulip manages like Redis, PostgreSQL,
   nginx, and memcached, the best choice is `N` to keep the
   currently installed version. But it's not important; the next
   step will re-install Zulip's configuration in any case.

   The `do-release-upgrade` tool will complete by prompting you to
   restart the system; press `N`, as we will do so later.

4. Next, we need to reinstall the current version of Zulip, which
   among other things will recompile Zulip's Python module
   dependencies for your new version of Python and rewrite Zulip's
   full-text search indexes to work with the upgraded dictionary
   packages:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /srv/zulip-venv-cache/*
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/lib/upgrade-zulip-stage-2 \
       /home/zulip/deployments/current/ --ignore-static-assets --audit-fts-indexes
   ```

5. As root, upgrade the database to the latest version of PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/upgrade-postgresql
   ```

6. Finally, Ubuntu 20.04 has a different version of the low-level
   glibc library, which affects how PostgreSQL orders text data (known
   as "collations"); this corrupts database indexes that rely on
   collations. Regenerate the affected indexes by running:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/reindex-textual-data --force
   ```

7. As root, restart the server:

   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

8. [Upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 to
   22.04](#upgrading-from-ubuntu-2004-focal-to-2204-jammy), so that
   you are running a supported operating system.

### Upgrading from Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial to 18.04 Bionic

1. Upgrade your server to the latest Zulip `2.1.x` release. You can
   only upgrade to Zulip 3.0 and newer after completing this process,
   since newer releases don't support Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial.

2. Same as for Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04.

3. Same as for Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04.

4. As root, upgrade the database installation and OS configuration to
   match the new OS version:

   ```bash
   touch /usr/share/postgresql/10/pgroonga_setup.sql.applied
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/zulip-puppet-apply -f
   pg_dropcluster 10 main --stop
   systemctl stop postgresql
   pg_upgradecluster 9.5 main
   pg_dropcluster 9.5 main
   apt remove postgresql-9.5
   systemctl start postgresql
   systemctl restart memcached
   ```

5. Finally, we need to reinstall the current version of Zulip, which
   among other things will recompile Zulip's Python module
   dependencies for your new version of Python:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /srv/zulip-venv-cache/*
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/lib/upgrade-zulip-stage-2 \
       /home/zulip/deployments/current/ --ignore-static-assets
   ```

   This will finish by restarting your Zulip server; you should now
   be able to navigate to its URL and confirm everything is working
   correctly.

6. [Upgrade to the latest `4.x` release](#upgrading-to-a-release).

7. As root, verify the contents of the full-text indexes:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py audit_fts_indexes
   ```

8. [Upgrade from Ubuntu 18.04 to
   20.04](#upgrading-from-ubuntu-1804-bionic-to-2004-focal), the next
   in chain of upgrades leading to a supported operating system.

### Upgrading from Debian 11 to 12

1. Upgrade your server to the latest `7.x` release.

2. As the Zulip user, stop the Zulip server and run the following
   to back up the system:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/stop-server
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py backup --output=/home/zulip/release-upgrade.backup.tar.gz
   ```

3. Follow [Debian's instructions to upgrade the OS][bookworm-upgrade].

   [bookworm-upgrade]: https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html

   When prompted for you how to upgrade configuration
   files for services that Zulip manages like Redis, PostgreSQL,
   nginx, and memcached, the best choice is `N` to keep the
   currently installed version. But it's not important; the next
   step will re-install Zulip's configuration in any case.

4. As root, run the following steps to regenerate configurations
   for services used by Zulip:

   ```bash
   apt remove upstart -y
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/zulip-puppet-apply -f
   ```

5. Reinstall the current version of Zulip, which among other things
   will recompile Zulip's Python module dependencies for your new
   version of Python:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /srv/zulip-venv-cache/*
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/lib/upgrade-zulip-stage-2 \
       /home/zulip/deployments/current/ --ignore-static-assets --audit-fts-indexes
   ```

   This will finish by restarting your Zulip server; you should now
   be able to navigate to its URL and confirm everything is working
   correctly.

6. As an additional step, you can also [upgrade the PostgreSQL version](#upgrading-postgresql).

### Upgrading from Debian 10 to 11

1. Upgrade your server to the latest `5.x` release. You can only
   upgrade to Zulip Server 6.0 and newer after completing this
   process, since newer releases don't support Debian 10.

2. As the Zulip user, stop the Zulip server and run the following
   to back up the system:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/stop-server
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py backup --output=/home/zulip/release-upgrade.backup.tar.gz
   ```

3. Follow [Debian's instructions to upgrade the OS][bullseye-upgrade].

   [bullseye-upgrade]: https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html

   When prompted for you how to upgrade configuration
   files for services that Zulip manages like Redis, PostgreSQL,
   nginx, and memcached, the best choice is `N` to keep the
   currently installed version. But it's not important; the next
   step will re-install Zulip's configuration in any case.

4. As root, run the following steps to regenerate configurations
   for services used by Zulip:

   ```bash
   apt remove upstart -y
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/zulip-puppet-apply -f
   ```

5. Reinstall the current version of Zulip, which among other things
   will recompile Zulip's Python module dependencies for your new
   version of Python:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /srv/zulip-venv-cache/*
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/lib/upgrade-zulip-stage-2 \
       /home/zulip/deployments/current/ --ignore-static-assets --audit-fts-indexes
   ```

   This will finish by restarting your Zulip server; you should now
   be able to navigate to its URL and confirm everything is working
   correctly.

6. Debian 11 has a different version of the low-level glibc
   library, which affects how PostgreSQL orders text data (known as
   "collations"); this corrupts database indexes that rely on
   collations. Regenerate the affected indexes by running:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/reindex-textual-data --force
   ```

7. As an additional step, you can also [upgrade the PostgreSQL version](#upgrading-postgresql).

8. [Upgrade from Debian 11 to 12](#upgrading-from-debian-11-to-12),
   so that you are running a supported operating system.

### Upgrading from Debian 9 to 10

1. Upgrade your server to the latest Zulip `2.1.x` release. You can
   only upgrade to Zulip 3.0 and newer after completing this process,
   since newer releases don't support Debian 9.

2. As the Zulip user, stop the Zulip server and run the following
   to back up the system:

   ```bash
   supervisorctl stop all
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py backup --output=/home/zulip/release-upgrade.backup.tar.gz
   ```

3. Follow [Debian's instructions to upgrade the OS][debian-upgrade-os].

   [debian-upgrade-os]: https://web.archive.org/web/20230314235744id_/https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html

   When prompted for you how to upgrade configuration
   files for services that Zulip manages like Redis, PostgreSQL,
   nginx, and memcached, the best choice is `N` to keep the
   currently installed version. But it's not important; the next
   step will re-install Zulip's configuration in any case.

4. As root, upgrade the database installation and OS configuration to
   match the new OS version:

   ```bash
   apt remove upstart -y
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/zulip-puppet-apply -f
   pg_dropcluster 11 main --stop
   systemctl stop postgresql
   pg_upgradecluster -m upgrade 9.6 main
   pg_dropcluster 9.6 main
   apt remove postgresql-9.6
   systemctl start postgresql
   service memcached restart
   ```

5. Finally, we need to reinstall the current version of Zulip, which
   among other things will recompile Zulip's Python module
   dependencies for your new version of Python:

   ```bash
   rm -rf /srv/zulip-venv-cache/*
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/lib/upgrade-zulip-stage-2 \
       /home/zulip/deployments/current/ --ignore-static-assets
   ```

   This will finish by restarting your Zulip server; you should now
   be able to navigate to its URL and confirm everything is working
   correctly.

6. [Upgrade to the latest `5.x` release](#upgrading-to-a-release), now
   that your server is running a supported operating system.

7. Debian 10 has a different version of the low-level glibc
   library, which affects how PostgreSQL orders text data (known as
   "collations"); this corrupts database indexes that rely on
   collations. Regenerate the affected indexes by running:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/setup/reindex-textual-data --force
   ```

8. As root, finish by verifying the contents of the full-text indexes:

   ```bash
   /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py audit_fts_indexes
   ```

9. [Upgrade from Debian 10 to 11](#upgrading-from-debian-10-to-11),
   the next in chain of upgrades leading to a supported operating
   system.
