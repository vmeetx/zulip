# Change your profile picture

By default, Zulip uses an image generated by
[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) as your profile picture.
If your email address already has a gravatar associated with it, Zulip will
use your existing gravatar.

You can also upload a custom profile picture to Zulip.

### Change your profile picture

### Change profile picture back to gravatar

   right corner of the profile picture.
