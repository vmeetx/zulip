## Browse and subscribe to channels

Everyone other than [guests](/help/guest-users) can subscribe to any
[public](/help/channel-permissions#public-channels) or
[web-public](/help/channel-permissions#web-public-channels) channel. Channel
administrators can [configure](/help/configure-who-can-subscribe) who can
subscribe to [private](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels) channels.

    You can click on the icons in the upper right to sort the list of channels

    **by number of subscribers** (<i class="fa fa-user-o"></i>), or

Access this feature by following the web app instructions in your mobile
device browser. You can also follow a link to an unsubscribed channel in
a Zulip message, press and hold the channel name until the long-press menu
appears, and tap **Subscribe**.

Implementation of a list of channels to subscribe to in the mobile app is
tracked [on GitHub](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/188).
If you're interested in this feature, please react to the issue's
description with üëç.
